## Basic Sublime Text 2 snippets for the Laravel template engine, Blade.

Got all the basic functions but, please if you can extend these snippets and make them better fork me and leave a comment on how I'm supposed to merge it into the original project since I am new to Git and my Git powers are very limited at the moment. 


### Installation

#### Linux
Open the Terminal and go into the .config/sublime-text-2/Packages/User/ folder and 'git clone https://github.com/villimagg/laravel-blade-snippets.git' and then you've got it.

#### Mac OSX
Don't know. Maybe some Mac user can provide info?

#### Windows
Don't know. Don't use Windows. Maybe some Windows user can provide info?


### Usage

Inside a .blade.php file type the name of the snippet you want to use. The name of the snippet is the same as the first part of the filename, e.g. the filename is 'if.sublime-snippet' then the snippet would be 'if' and hit TAB on your keyboard.
