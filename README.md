# Basic Sublime Text 2 snippets for Laravel Blade template engine

Got all the basic functions but please if you can extend these snippets and make them better fork me.


## Installation

### Linux
Open the Terminal, go into the `~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/User/` folder and `git clone` the repository.

### Mac OSX
Go into the ST2 `Packages/User` folder (the path should be `~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/User/`) and [clone the repository](#cloning-the-repository).

### Windows

Go into the ST2 `Packages/User` folder (usually the path is `C:\Users\$USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages\User`) and [clone the repository](#cloning-the-repository).

#### Cloning the repository

`$ git clone https://github.com/villimagg/laravel-blade-snippets.git`

*Tip*: If you don't find the `Packages/User` folder, you can go to **Preferences > Browser Packages...**


## Usage

Inside a `.blade.php` file type the name of the snippet you want to use. The name of the snippet is the same as the first part of the filename, e.g. the filename is `if.sublime-snippet` then the snippet would be `if` and hit TAB on your keyboard.
